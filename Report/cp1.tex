\section{Proposal}

\subsection{Survey}

This section is supposed to enumerate (at least) \emph{four} references and
briefly summarize the main insight they provided (1 paragraph each). All
references should also be included in the References section that concludes the
report.

TODO All (2 Papers Fabian)

\begin{packed_enum}
   \item \ldots
   \item \ldots
   \item \ldots
   \item \ldots
   \item Additional references \ldots
\end{packed_enum}

\subsection{System}

We chose MongoDB as the basis for our project.

\paragraph{Rationale} Why is this type of system interesting to you? (1-2
paragraphs)

TODO Stefan

In the following, discuss \emph{four} interesting
features/capabilities/properties of the chosen system (1 paragraph each).
\begin{packed_enum}
    \item \ldots
    \item \ldots
    \item \ldots
    \item \ldots
    \item Additional features/capabilities/properties \ldots
\end{packed_enum}

\subsection{Application Description}

Describe your application scenario (2-3 paragraphs) and justify why this
fits your system of choice (1-2 paragraphs).

TODO Fabian

\paragraph{Architectural Overview}

Provide an overview on the planned architecture/pipeline of your application.
For example: Programming language(s), 3rd-party libraries/frameworks and their
role in your application pipeline (1 paragraph each), planned/desired
deployment, \ldots

TODO Daniel

\paragraph{Experimental Data}

For each dataset, describe the origin as well as the properties/contents.
Moreover, justify why the respective datasets suit your application (2-3
paragraphs each).

TODO Stefan

\subsection{Roadmap}

TODO Daniel

\emph{Optional}. Split your project into individual steps and provide a first
roadmap for the project/semester. You may use the \verb|vroadmap| environment
(see \verb|report.tex| for definition):

\begin{vroadmap}
  YYYY-mm-dd & Step 1 \tabularnewline
  YYYY-mm-dd & Step 2 \tabularnewline
  \ldots & \ldots \tabularnewline
\end{vroadmap}
