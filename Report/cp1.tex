\section{Proposal}

\subsection{Survey}

This section is supposed to enumerate (at least) \emph{four} references and
briefly summarize the main insight they provided (1 paragraph each). All
references should also be included in the References section that concludes the
report.

TODO All (2 Papers Fabian)

\begin{packed_enum}
   \item
As Bigtable we understand a distributed storage that is scaleable for a very large size of data. It is stated that many big projects like, Google Earth, Google Analytics and Google Finance, make use of the Bigtable technology. For services in this dimension, such a system has to be stable in latency and also should be able to handle huge data size. Bigtable therefor is a technology that meets this high demand needs. It works with clustering where you can simply add more machines to the system for more demanding applications.  \cite{bigTable}
   \item \ldots
   \item \ldots
   \item \ldots
   \item Additional references \ldots
\end{packed_enum}

\subsection{System}

We chose MongoDB as the basis for our project.

\paragraph{Rationale} Why is this type of system interesting to you? (1-2
paragraphs)

TODO Stefan

In the following, discuss \emph{four} interesting
features/capabilities/properties of the chosen system (1 paragraph each).
\begin{packed_enum}
    \item \ldots
    \item \ldots
    \item \ldots
    \item \ldots
    \item Additional features/capabilities/properties \ldots
\end{packed_enum}

\subsection{Application Description}

Describe your application scenario (2-3 paragraphs) and justify why this
fits your system of choice (1-2 paragraphs).

TODO Fabian

\paragraph{Architectural Overview}

Provide an overview on the planned architecture/pipeline of your application.
For example: Programming language(s), 3rd-party libraries/frameworks and their
role in your application pipeline (1 paragraph each), planned/desired
deployment, \ldots

TODO Daniel

\paragraph{Experimental Data}

For each dataset, describe the origin as well as the properties/contents.
Moreover, justify why the respective datasets suit your application (2-3
paragraphs each).

TODO Stefan

\subsection{Roadmap}

TODO Daniel

\emph{Optional}. Split your project into individual steps and provide a first
roadmap for the project/semester. You may use the \verb|vroadmap| environment
(see \verb|report.tex| for definition):

\begin{vroadmap}
  YYYY-mm-dd & Step 1 \tabularnewline
  YYYY-mm-dd & Step 2 \tabularnewline
  \ldots & \ldots \tabularnewline
\end{vroadmap}
